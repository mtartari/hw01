Repository for first CFSS homework assignment

This is my attempt at editing the file README.md from within GitHub. 
I followed the instructions available at this [link](http://uc-cfss.github.io/).
Some more thoughts follow.

## My experience with RMarkdown
The cheatsheet is *very* useful. But it is not yet very clear to me how convenient this is given that I type my papers in Lyx or use directly Latex. **Time will tell!**

## My experience with GitHub
I feel quite unsure about how exactly "this" works and how it is supposed to be useful when doing empirical research. But I am very eager to get better at using this tool and reaping the benefits.

I am next going to try to modify this file from within RStudio ... (let's hope it works)
